#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Requested by Louise

##Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends and successful traits to launch a successful campaign for Louise and fund her play. 
 
*The total number of Kickstarter campaigns is just over 4,000.
 
*We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.
 
*The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
 
 ###Based on these statistics, we can determine the following:

*The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.

*The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.

*Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

From the plots chart we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.

#### Overview of Project
Louise has asked to help her launch a successful kickstarter campaign using Kickstarter previous campaign data. The overview of the project is to determine connections, similar traits and trends based of funding goals and launch date. Data was collected from Kickstarter's successfull, canceled, and failed campaigns and filter as directed by Louise.

##### Purpose
The purpose of project is know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

###### Analysis and Challenges
The analysis started with the collection of data from Kickstarter campaigns that can be campared to Louise's Play Campaign. Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Then the data was filtered to better match the campaign Louise is planning such as goals, pledged, location and plays specifically. Then we created visualization chart and graphics to better illustrate successful traits. 

####### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcome based on the launch date analysis is that May and June are great months to launch Louise's campaign for FEVER. 

######## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcome based on goals analysis concluded that keeping the campaign goals below $4000 was more likely to be successful while going above $4000, even though their are rare events, does not lead to a high success rate. 

######### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge and differences encountered was picking the right functions and equstions to preform accurate data collection. The problem was overcomed by further explaining the desired reason and result of the analysis.

*Two conclusions I can make from the outcomes based on launch date, first is that the best months to launch would be during May and June and starts to decline low after July. Second is that September through March are bad times to launch a campaign. 

*The conclustion I can make from outcomes based on goals is that successful campaigns kept their goals under or below $4000. Failed campaigns where extreme after $3500. 

*The limitations of the data collection. Data was only collected from one source Kickstarter aswell as filtered specific subcatagories and region but not further filtered by genre . Genre can further connect Louise's play campaign to the dataset. 

*For the project many graphs can be created such as pie chart and scatter plots to better show differences and success of campaigns for $4000 goals.
