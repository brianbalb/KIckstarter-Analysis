#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Requested by Louise

Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends and successful traits to launch a successful campaign for Louise and fund her play. 
 
The total number of Kickstarter campaigns is just over 4,000.
 
We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.
 
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
 
 Based on these statistics, we can determine the following:

*The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
*The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.
*Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

From the plots chart we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
